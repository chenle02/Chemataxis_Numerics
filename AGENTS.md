# Repository Guidelines (Chemataxis\_Numerics)

This repository is a public, GitHub-Pages-facing home for **numerical outputs** (images/videos) accompanying our chemotaxis papers.
It is intentionally separate from the manuscript + code repo.

## GitHub Pages

- Pages source: publish from the `docs/` folder (Settings → Pages → `master` / `docs`).
- All publishable assets should live under `docs/` so they are served by Pages.

## Results Organization (Subfolders First)

We expect **hundreds/thousands** of files; do **not** put everything in one folder.

- Root for results: `docs/results/`
- Use **subfolders** where the folder path carries most of the meaning, e.g.
  - `docs/results/subcritical/m05_b1_g2/chi_11.9700/N50/T100/eps_1e-3/`
  - `docs/results/supercritical/beta0/chi_2.1900/N50/T100/eps_1e-3/`

Filenames inside a run folder can be simple, e.g. `summary6.png`, `summary6.jpeg`, `movie.mp4`, etc.

## Per-Folder Documentation + Gallery

Each meaningful results folder should include:

- `README.md`: what was run, parameter choices, and how to reproduce (with links to the code repo scripts/configs).
- `fancy.html`: a refined gallery for that folder (search/filter UI is allowed), generated by helper scripts (e.g. `codes/make_subcritical_gallery.py` from the manuscript/code repo), then copied into this folder.

## Large Files (Videos)

- For videos (and other large binaries), prefer Git LFS:
  - `git lfs track "*.mp4" "*.mov" "*.webm"`
  - commit the resulting `.gitattributes`

## What Belongs Here vs. the Code Repo

- Put **run scripts, YAML configs, raw logs, and reproducibility notes** in the manuscript/code repo.
- Put **curated outputs** (selected images/videos + per-folder `README.md` + `fancy.html`) in this public repo.
